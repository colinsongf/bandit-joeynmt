# &nbsp; ![Joey-NMT](joey-small.png) Joey NMT

## Goal and Purpose
Joey NMT framework is developed for educational purposes. 
It aims to be a **clean** and **minimalistic** code base to help novices 
pursuing the understanding of the following questions.
- How to implement classic NMT architectures (RNN and Transformer) in PyTorch?
- What are the building blocks of these architectures and how do they interact?
- How to modify these blocks (e.g. deeper, wider, ...)?
- How to modify the training procedure (e.g. add a regularizer)?

In contrast to other NMT frameworks, we will **not** aim for 
state-of-the-art results or speed through engineering or training tricks
since this often goes in hand with an increase in code complexity 
and a decrease in readability.

However, Joey NMT re-implements baselines from major publications.

## Contributors

Joey NMT is developed by [Joost Bastings](https://bastings.github.io) (University of Amsterdam) and [Julia Kreutzer](http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~kreutzer/) (Heidelberg University).

## Features
We aim to implement the following features (aka the minimalist toolkit of NMT):
- Recurrent Encoder-Decoder with GRUs or LSTMs
- Transformer Encoder-Decoder
- Attention Types: MLP, Dot, Multi-Head, Bilinear
- Word-, BPE- and character-based input handling
- BLEU, ChrF evaluation
- Beam search with length penalty and greedy decoding
- Customizable initialization
- Attention visualization
- Learning curve plotting

[Work in progress: Transformer, Multi-Head and Dot still missing.]

## Coding
In order to keep the code clean and readable, we make use of:
- Style checks: Pylint, PEP8
- Typing
- Docstrings

[Work in progress!]


## Teaching
We will create dedicated material for teaching with Joey NMT. This will include:
- An overview and explanation of the code architecture.
- A tutorial how to train and test a baseline model.
- A walk-through example of how to implement a modification of a baseline model.

[Work in progress!]

## Installation
Joey NMT is built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) v.0.4.1 and [torchtext](https://github.com/pytorch/text) for Python >= 3.6.

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt.git`
2. Install the requirements:
`cd joeynmt`
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (you might want to add `--user` for a local installation).


## Usage
Models are specified in configuration files, in simple [YAML](http://yaml.org/) format. You can find examples in the `configs` directory.

## Documentation
Read [the docs](https://joeynmt.readthedocs.io).

### Training
For training, run 

`python3 -m joeynmt train configs/default.yaml`. 

This will train a model on the training data specified in the config (here: `default.yaml`), 
validate on validation data, 
and store model parameters, vocabularies, validation outputs and a small number of attention plots in the `model_dir` (also specified in config).

The `validations.txt` file in the model directory reports the validation results at every validation point. 
Models are saved whenever a new best validation score is reached, in `batch_no.ckpt`, where `batch_no` is the number of batches the model has been trained on so far.

For training on a GPU, set `use_cuda` in the config file to `True`.

Note that pre-processing like tokenization or BPE-ing is not included in training, but has to be done manually before.

Tip: Be careful not to overwrite models, set `overwrite: False` in the model configuration.

### Testing
For testing, run 

`python3 -m joeynmt test configs/default.yaml --output_path out`.

This will generate translations for validation and test set in `out.[dev|test]` (optional)
with the latest model in the `model_dir` (or a specific checkpoint set with `load_model`).
It will also evaluate the outputs with `eval_metric`.

Note that post-processing like detokenization or de-BPE-ing is not included in this step, but has to be done manually.


## Benchmarks
Benchmarks on small models trained on GPU/CPU on standard data sets will be 
posted here.

- IWSLT15 En-Vi, word-based
- IWSLT14 De-En, 32000 joint BPE, word-based
- WMT17 En-De and Lv-En, 32000 joint BPE

### IWSLT English-Vietnamese

We compare against [Tensorflow NMT](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) on the IWSLT15 En-Vi data set as preprocessed by Stanford.
You can download the data with `scripts/get_iwslt15_envi.sh`, and then use `configs/iwslt_envi_luong.yaml` to replicate the experiment.

We also compare against [xnmt](https://github.com/neulab/xnmt/tree/master/recipes/stanford-iwslt) which uses different hyperparameters, so we use a different configuration for Joey NMT too: `configs/iwslt_envi_xnmt.yaml`.

### IWSLT  German-English
We compare against the baseline scores reported in [(Wiseman & Rush, 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02960.pdf) (W&R), 
[(Bahdanau et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.07086.pdf) (B17) with tokenized, lowercased BLEU (using `sacrebleu`).
áº€e compare a word-based model of the same size and vocabulary as in W&R and B17.
The [script](https://github.com/harvardnlp/BSO/blob/master/data_prep/MT/prepareData.sh) to obtain and pre-process the data is the one published with W&R.
On a K40-GPU word-level training took <1h, beam search decoding for both dev and test <2min.

Joey NMT (beam=10, alpha=1.0) | word | 28.96 | 27.03| 22.05M | 

On CPU (`use_cuda: False`): 
(approx 8-10x slower: 8h for training, beam search decoding for both dev and test 19min, greedy decoding 5min)

Joey NMT (beam=10, alpha=1.0) | word | 28.85 | 27.06 | 22.05M | 

In addition, we compare to a BPE-based GRU model with 32k (Groundhog style). 
Use `scripts/get_iwslt14_bpe.sh` to pre-process the data and `configs/iwslt14_deen_bpe.yaml` to train the model.

Systems | level | dev | test | #params | Joey NMT config
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:  
Joey NMT (greedy) | bpe | 27.8 | | 60.68M | 
Joey NMT (beam=5, alpha=1.0) | bpe | 28.74 | 27.63 | 60.68M |

## WMT 17 English-German and Latvian-English
We compare against the results for recurrent BPE-based models that were reported in the [Sockeye paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05690.pdf). 
We only consider the ``Groundhog`` setting here, where toolkits are used out-of-the-box for creating a Groundhog-like model (1 layer, LSTMs, MLP attention).
The data is pre-processed as described in the paper ([code](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/tree/arxiv_1217/arxiv/code)).
Postprocessing is done with [Moses' detokenizer](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/detokenizer.perl), evaluation with `sacrebleu`.

Note that the scores reported for other models might not reflect the current state of the code, but the state at the time of the Sockeye evaluation.
Please also consider the difference in number of parameters despite "the same" setup: our models are the smallest in numbers of parameters.

### English-German
Groundhog setting: `encoder rnn=500`, `lr=0.0003`, `bridge=True`

Systems | level | dev | test | #params | Joey NMT config

Joey NMT (beam=5) | bpe | 24.33 | 23.45  | 86.37M | `configs/wmt_ende_default.yaml`  

The Joey NMT model was trained for 4 days (14 epochs).
